# **Project Overview: Accessible Recipes**

## **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to take an existing drink recipe website and rebuild it following best practices for accessibility. The original site, created in a previous course, is currently inaccessible for screen readers and lacks responsiveness. Our work will focus on transforming this site into a fully accessible and inclusive experience for all users.

---

## **Project Objectives**
Our primary focus is to adapt the existing site to meet modern accessibility standards. Specifically, we aim to address the following:

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Ensure the site structure allows seamless tabbing through all elements.
   
2. **Screen Reader Compatibility:**
   - Use HTML elements effectively to support assistive technologies.
   - Enable smooth interaction with features such as search fields, navigation, and recipe reading.

3. **Zoom and Magnification:**
   - Ensure that the site functions properly at various levels of zoom and magnification, meeting standards discussed in the course workshops.

4. **Mobile-First Design:**
   - Guarantee accessibility across all screen sizes, with a focus on responsive design.

---

## **Approach**
Our work will include:

- **Research:** Investigating accessibility best practices and exploring relevant HTML elements and principles outlined in WCAG 2.1.
- **Iterative Development:** Continuously implementing and refining features to ensure the site maintains its form and function while improving accessibility.
- **Testing:** Conducting user testing with accessibility tools, such as screen readers and keyboard navigation, to validate our implementation.

---

## **Key Principles**
We will apply the knowledge gained during the course and build upon it through further exploration of accessibility standards. Our efforts will focus on:

- Structuring content for assistive technologies.
- Ensuring compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices.
- Prioritizing a user-friendly experience for all individuals, including those with disabilities.
